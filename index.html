  <h3>Our own class tips for learning English</h3>

  <p>Make it a rule to speak only English at home for one hour! If you break the rule, you have to pay a fine!</p>

  <p>Read the labels on everyday items like bottles of shampoo or hand cream!</p>

  

  <p>Listen to the radio!</p>

  <p>Some of you watch music videos and fill in the lyrics on lyricstraining.com</p>

  <p>Some of you use the app duolingo.com</p>

  <p>Stay safe online! The BBC has an app that’s good for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/ownit/take-control"></a>children and adults </a></p>


  <p>Look at the British Council lessons</p>

  <P>British Council have lots of useful lessons and information to help while schools and colleges are closed. These are their top tips for teenagers home-learning.</P>


<H5>Plan your day</H5>
<P>Think about how you're going to spend each day. Get up at the same time each day (not too late!) and get showered and dressed as if you were going to go to school. It's important not to stay in your pyjamas all day as you won't feel like studying in your PJs! Make a timetable to plan activities for the day – put 20–30 minutes of English learning into your timetable and see ideas below for activities.</P>

<h5>Balance online and offline activity</h5>
<p>For many teenagers more time at home will mean spending even more time than usual online. Be aware of how long you spend online each day and take regular screen breaks to stretch and take your eyes off the screen. Also, make sure you switch off tablets and phones at least an hour before you go to bed. It's also important to limit the amount of news you read and hear about the virus. You should keep informed, but try not to follow the news all day, every day.</p>

<h5>Exercise and healthy eating</h5>
<p>Try to take some exercise each day. There are lots of exercise tutorials being shared online that you can do at home, so find one you enjoy and follow the videos that are offered. Try to eat meals at regular times and ensure you eat fresh fruit and vegetables and drink plenty of water.</p>

<h5>Keep in touch with school friends</h5>
<p>Keeping in touch with your school friends is important but you don't have to be connected every minute of the day! Work out what you think is a good amount of time to be connected to friends.</p>

<h5>Think of others and help when you can</h5>
<p>This is a difficult time for you, but it's also going to be difficult for the other people in your home. Your parents/carers will be adjusting to changes in their own lives too and will have additional concerns about their jobs etc. We all need to be more patient than ever at this time. If you can, think about others who are less fortunate than you are and if there are ways you can help to support friends and neighbours, then do so. Loads of great ideas are appearing, and people are showing how creativity can really help in unusual situations like this one.</p>

<h5>Learn something new</h5>
<p>Set yourself a challenge to learn something new. This is the perfect opportunity to learn skills that take time. There are many video tutorials to help you. So improve your typing skills, learn to juggle, learn how to cook – whatever you want, but try to make the most of this extra time.</p>
